- 👋 Hi, I’m Mehdi khajavi. I have finished my master's degree in structural engineering at the University
-  of Mohaghegh Ardabili,Iran with a thesis entitled ''Optimal Placement of Sensors for Experimental Modal Analysis''.
- The algorithm for my thesis is written in MATLAB and it uses Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) for finding the best solution.
-  I started programming with MATLAB. However currently I have started to learn python.
- 👀 My research interests include Structural Engineering, Structural Health Monitoring, Damage Detection, and Optimal Sensor Placement.
- In addition, I'm interested in neural network, Machine Learning, Wavelet Analysis, and Optimization Algorithim.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Data Science and Neural Network.
- So far, I have gained detailed experience in working with several softwares in Structural Engineering fields, such as Opensees, Abaqus,
-  SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, and CST Studio Suite, and also I am fairly competent at programming with PYTHON, R and MATLAB
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on doing research and programming in the area of Structure Health Monitoring and Dynamic of Structure.
