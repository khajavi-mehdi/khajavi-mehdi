👋 Hi, I’m Mehdi Khajavi. I'm currently pursuing a Master’s in Construction Management and Engineering at the University of Twente, specializing in BIM, digital twin technologies, and smart infrastructure.

🔍 My academic background includes a Master's in Structural Engineering from the University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Iran, where I completed a thesis on "Optimal Sensor Placement for Experimental Modal Analysis" using MATLAB and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO).

🌱 I’m passionate about advancing Digital Twin, Bim, Structural Health Monitoring, Damage Detection, Optimal Sensor Placement, and exploring the potentials of neural networks, machine learning, wavelet analysis, and optimization algorithms in civil engineering.

💻 Skilled in Python, R, MATLAB, and structural engineering software like OpenSees, Abaqus, SAP2000, ETABS, SAFE, and CST Studio Suite, I aim to blend innovative technologies like BIM and digital twins with traditional engineering practices.

💞️ I'm keen on collaborating on projects and research that integrate Structural Health Monitoring and the dynamics of smart infrastructures, applying my skills in both traditional and cutting-edge technologies.
